        <p>For my pygame, this might be hard to understand what to do. This will guide you on how to play. </p>

        <section id="how-to-play">
            <h2><strong>Objective:</strong></h2>
            <p>Your goal is to help the player character (P) collect all the keys (K) and reach the door (D) without being caught by the guards (G).</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Movement:</strong></h2>
            <p>Use the arrow keys to move the player character (P) around the grid.</p>

            <h2><strong>Collect Keys:</strong></h2>
            <p>Move to the square which the keys (K) are in to collect them. The keys will disappear from the grid once collected.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Open the Door:</strong></h2>
            <p>When you have collected all the keys, you can move to the door (D) to win the game. The game will end, and you will be declared the winner.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Avoid Guards:</strong></h2>
            <p>Be careful of the guards (G) patrolling the area. If a guard catches you, you will lose the game.</p>

            <h2><strong>Game Over:</strong></h2>
            <p>If you win or lose the game, a message will appear on the screen. To play again, press the SPACE key.</p>

    <section id="tips_and_warnings">
        <h1>Tips, warnings and things to be aware of:</h1>
        <p style="background-color: green;">The faster you press the arrow keys, the faster you will move. By going at a fast speed, this can be useful when escaping the guards!</p>
        <p style="background-color: green;">The guards cannot reach you if their path is obstructed! This means if a wall is in there way they will stop moving.</p>
        <p style="background-color: #ffd633;">But don't take this for granted. They will move with you. For example, if you move left and the path is obstructed, they will move left. If you move right, they will move right. But if you move up or down but stay in the same y-column they will not move</p>
        <p style="background-color: #ffd633;">Be careful about open space; guards can get you</p>
        <p style="background-color: red;">But remember this: As soon as the path becomes unobstructed, the guards will move to get you, no matter if you move or not.</p>
        <p style="background-color: red;"> When you get one key, the way the guards are positioned might then pose a significant threat to you, so a small amount of skill is required to tactifully escape the guards.</p>
